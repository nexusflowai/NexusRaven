However, we include general domain data from the ToolLLM and ToolAlpaca papers. Since the data in the ToolLLM and ToolAlpaca works use OpenAI's GPT models for the generated content, the data is not commercially licensable, even if our own data is. As a result, the evaluation data used here is strictly non-commercial under [CC-BY-NC-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/). Thank you for understanding!
